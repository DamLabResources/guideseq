# guideseq: The GUIDE-Seq Analysis Package
[![travis badge](https://travis-ci.org/aryeelab/guideseq.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/aryeelab/guideseq)

The guideseq package implements our data preprocessing and analysis pipeline for GUIDE-Seq data. It takes raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) and a parameter manifest file (.yaml) as input and produces a table of annotated off-target sites as output.


## Features


The package implements a pipeline consisting of a read preprocessing module followed by an off-target identification module. The preprocessing module takes raw reads (FASTQ) from a pooled multi-sample sequencing run as input. Reads are demultiplexed into sample-specific FASTQs and PCR duplicates are removed using unique molecular index (UMI) barcode information.

The individual pipeline steps are:

1. **Sample demultiplexing**: A pooled multi-sample sequencing run is demultiplexed into sample-specific read files based on sample-specific dual-indexed barcodes
2. **Read UMITagging**: Reads from demultiplexed samples are 
3. **PCR Duplicate Consolidation**:Reads that share the same UMI and the same first six bases of genomic sequence are presumed to originate from the same pre-PCR molecule and are thus consolidated into a single consensus read to improve quantitative interpretation of GUIDE-Seq read counts.
4. **Read Alignment**: The demultiplexed, consolidated paired end reads are aligned to a reference genome using the BWA-MEM algorithm with default parameters (Li. H, 2009).
5. **Candidate Site Identification**: The start mapping positions of the read amplified with the tag-specific primer (second of pair) are tabulated on a genome-wide basis. Start mapping positions are consolidated using a 10-bp sliding window. Windows with reads mapping to both + and - strands, or to the same strand but amplified with both forward and reverse tag-specific primers, are flagged as sites of potential DSBs. 25 bp of reference sequence is retrieved on either side of the most frequently occuring start-mapping position in each flagged window. The retrieved sequence is aligned to the intended target sequence using a Smith-Waterman local-alignment algorithm. 
6. **False positive filtering**: Off-target cleavage sites with more than six mismatches to the intended target sequence, or that are present in background controls, are filtered out.
7. **Reporting**: Identified off-targets, sorted by GUIDE-Seq read count are annotated in a final output table. The GUIDE-Seq read count is expected to scale approximately linearly with cleavage rates (Tsai et al., *Nat Biotechnol.* 2015).
8. **Visualization**: Alignment of detected off-target sites is visualized via a color-coded sequence grid, as seen below:

## Dependencies
* Python (2.7)
* Reference genome fasta file ([Example](<http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-82/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa.gz>))
* [`bwa`](<http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/>) alignment tool
* [`bedtools`](<http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>) genome arithmetic utility

## Getting Set Up

### Install Dependencies

To run guideseq, you must first install all necessary dependencies:

- **Python 2.7**: If a version does not come bundled with your operating system, we recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) scientific Python package.
- **Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (bwa)**: You can either install bwa with a package manager (`brew` on OSX or `apt-get` on Linux), or you can download it from the [project page](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) and compile it from source.
- **Bedtools**: You can either install bwa with a package manager (`brew` on OSX or `apt-get` on Linux), or you can download it from the [project page](http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/installation.html) and compile it from source.

For both bwa and bedtools, make sure you know the path to the respective executables, as they are necessary pipeline inputs.


### Download Reference Genome

The guideseq package requires a reference genome for read mapping. You can use any modern human reference genome of your choosing, but for all of our testing and original GUIDE-seq analyses (Tsai et al. *Nature Biotechnol* 2015) we use [hg38](http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-82/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa.gz). Be sure to unzip the gunzipped FASTA file before use.

### Download and Set Up guideseq

Once all dependencies are installed, there are a few easy steps to download and set up the guideseq package:

1. Obtain a copy of the guideseq package source code. You can either download and unzip the latest source from the github [release page](https://github.com/aryeelab/guideseq/releases), or you use git to clone the repository by running `git clone --recursive https://github.com/aryeelab/guideseq.git`
2. Install guideseq dependencies by entering the guideseq directory and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once all guideseq dependencies are installed, you will be ready to start using guideseq!


## Running the Full Analysis Pipeline

To run the full guideseq analysis pipeline, you must first create a manifest YAML file that describes all pipeline inputs. Once you have done so, you can simply run

```
python /path/to/guideseq.py all -m /path/to/manifest.yaml
```
to run the entire pipeline. Below are specific instructions detailing how to write the manifest file.

### Writing A Manifest File
When running the end-to-end analysis functionality of the guideseq package, a number of inputs are required. To simplify the formatting of these inputs and to encourage reproducibility, these parameters are inputted into the pipeline via a manifest formatted as a YAML file. YAML files allow easy-to-read specification of key-value pairs. This allows us to easily specify our parameters. The following fields are required in the manifest:

- `reference_genome`: The absolute path to the reference genome FASTA file.
- `output_folder`: The absolute path to the folder in which all pipeline outputs will be saved.
- `bwa`: The absolute path to the `bwa` executable
- `bedtools`: The absolute path to the `bedtools` executable
- `undemultiplexed`: The absolute paths to the undemultiplexed paired end sequencing files. The required parameters are:
	- `forward`: The absolute path to the FASTQ file containing the forward reads.
	- `reverse`: The absolute path to the FASTQ file containing the reverse reads.
	- `index1`: The absolute path to the FASTQ file containing the forward index reads.
	- `index2`: The absolute path to the FASTQ file containing the reverse index reads.

An example `undemultiplexed` field:

```
undemultiplexed:
    forward: ../test/data/undemux.r1.fastq.gz
    reverse: ../test/data/undemux.r2.fastq.gz
    index1: ../test/data/undemux.i1.fastq.gz
    index2: ../test/data/undemux.i2.fastq.gz
```

- `samples`: A nested field containing the details of each sample. At least two samples must be specified: a "control" sample (to be used to filter out background off-target sites) and at least one treatment sample. The required parameters are:
	- `target`: The sample targetsites
	- `barcode1`: The forward barcode
	- `barcode2`: The reverse barcode
	- `description`: A description of the sample

An example `samples` field:

```
samples:
    control:
        target:
        barcode1: CTCTCTAC
        barcode2: CTCTCTAT
        description: Control

    EMX1:
        target: GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAANGG
        barcode1: TAGGCATG
        barcode2: TAGATCGC
        description: EMX1
```

### A Full Manifest File Example

Below is an example of a full manifest file. Feel free to copy it and replace the parameters with your own experiment data. Remember that you can input more than just one treatment sample (e.g. the "EMX1" data below).

```
reference_genome: /Volumes/Media/hg38/hg38.fa
output_folder: ../test/output

bwa: bwa
bedtools: bedtools

undemultiplexed:
    forward: ../test/data/undemux.r1.fastq.gz
    reverse: ../test/data/undemux.r2.fastq.gz
    index1: ../test/data/undemux.i1.fastq.gz
    index2: ../test/data/undemux.i2.fastq.gz

samples:
    control:
        target:
        barcode1: CTCTCTAC
        barcode2: CTCTCTAT
        description: Control

    EMX1:
        target: GAGTCCGAGCAGAAGAAGAANGG
        barcode1: TAGGCATG
        barcode2: TAGATCGC
        description: EMX1
```
